# libcppio

Libcppio provides uniform interface for various I/O lines, currently supported are:

 * inproc - inter-thread communication within one process
 * local - inter-process communication within one system
 * tcp - inter-system communication within TCP network

Not ready for production yet, but I would really love any feedback.
